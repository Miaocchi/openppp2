/**
 * @file YieldContext.h
 * @brief Declares the stackful coroutine yield/resume context used throughout the PPP
 *        event-driven state machine (EDSM) infrastructure.
 *
 * @details
 * ## Design Overview
 *
 * `YieldContext` is a manually-managed, stackful coroutine context that integrates with
 * Boost.Asio's `io_context` execution model without relying on `boost::asio::spawn` or
 * `boost::coroutines2`.  Instead it owns a raw `boost::context::fcontext_t` stack and
 * performs symmetric context switches via `boost::context::detail::jump_fcontext`.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 * ```
 * io_context thread                coroutine stack
 *      |                                 |
 *      |-- YieldContext::Spawn() ------->|  (allocates stack, posts first Resume)
 *      |                                 |
 *      |<-- asio::post fires Resume() ---|
 *      |       jump_fcontext  ---------->|  SpawnHander(yield) runs
 *      |                                 |
 *      |           [async I/O needed]    |
 *      |<----------- Suspend() ----------|  jump back to caller
 *      |                                 |
 *      |    [I/O completion callback]    |
 *      |---------- R() / Resume() ------>|  jump back to coroutine
 *      |                                 |
 *      |           [handler returns]     |
 *      |<----------- ~YieldContext() ----|  stack freed
 * ```
 *
 * ### `nullof<YieldContext>()` — Synchronous vs Asynchronous Mode
 *
 * Many functions in this project accept a `YieldContext&` parameter.  The parameter
 * is tested against `nullof<YieldContext>()` at the call site:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * // Inside an async helper:
 * if (&y == nullof<YieldContext>()) {
 *     // Caller does NOT have a coroutine context — block the calling thread
 *     // using a std::condition_variable or similar synchronisation primitive.
 * } else {
 *     // Caller IS running inside a coroutine — suspend via y.Suspend(),
 *     // post a wakeup, and resume transparently.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `nullof<YieldContext>()` returns a pointer whose address is a sentinel value
 * (typically the address of a static null object).  Passing this sentinel instead of
 * a real `YieldContext&` signals "synchronous / thread-blocking mode".  This is **not**
 * undefined behaviour — the framework explicitly defines and relies on this convention.
 * **Do not remove or modify this pattern.**
 *
 * @note  `YieldContext` is non-copyable and non-movable.  Instances are created
 *        exclusively through the `Spawn` family of static factory methods and destroyed
 *        automatically when the coroutine handler returns.
 * @note  All `Spawn` overloads are thread-safe with respect to the target `io_context`.
 * ### Anchored suspend / resume
 *
 * Every suspension is identified by an anchor: a per-coroutine, strictly increasing
 * number taken with `Arm()` before the asynchronous operation is started.  The
 * completion handler captures the returned `Anchor` and wakes the coroutine with
 * `anchor.R()`, which compare-and-swaps the published anchor to zero.  Exactly one
 * wakeup per suspension can win; a duplicate wakeup (I/O completion racing a
 * timeout), a late wakeup from an earlier suspension, or a wakeup arriving after the
 * coroutine finished fails the CAS and is discarded without touching the coroutine:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * YieldContext::Anchor anchor = y.Arm();
 * socket.async_read_some(buffer, [anchor, &n](const error_code& ec, size_t sz) noexcept {
 *     n = ec ? -1 : (int)sz;
 *     anchor.R();
 * });
 * y.Suspend(anchor);
 * ```
 *
 * The anchor state lives in a shared cell owned jointly by the context and every
 * outstanding `Anchor`, so `R()` stays safe after the coroutine has been reclaimed.
 *
 * @note  `Arm()` and `Suspend()` may only be called from inside the coroutine body.
 *        `Anchor::R()` may be called from any thread.

         *
         * @details
         * Each `YieldContext` instance encapsulates a dedicated stack allocation and a
         * pair of `fcontext_t` handles (`callee_` / `caller_`) that represent the
         * bidirectional jump targets between the coroutine body and the Asio event loop.
         *
         * The state flag `s_` is guarded by the anchor cell mutex and serialises
         * concurrent resume / suspend transitions.  Wakeups are anchored (see the file
         * overview): only the wakeup whose anchor wins the CAS is delivered.  A winning
         * wakeup that arrives while the coroutine is still running, or while it is in
         * the middle of its suspend handoff, is latched into `wakeup_pending_`; because
         * the latch can only be set for the current anchor, the matching `Suspend()`
         * consumes it and no later suspension can ever observe it.  This keeps the
         * completion-before-suspend interleaving lossless when the owning `io_context`
         * is executed by more than one `run()` thread.  The mutex is never held across
         * a `jump_fcontext` call.
         *
         * @warning Never construct directly — use the `Spawn` static factory methods.
